# IC Wildlife Android app

Enabling file upload across different android versions is painful to implement and is a well known issue.
It is such a well known issue that a public GitHub project was made to assist developers with this functionality. 

Ghazi Khan made the Os-FileUp project (https://github.com/mgks/Os-FileUp) and described it as "an Android WebView Project to help app developers understand how to upload and process image for any hybrid app". 
His sample code was used to enable file upload across different android versions for this projects android app.
